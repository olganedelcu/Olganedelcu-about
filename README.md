# Hey!👋🏼I'm Olga
I'm a Operations Analyst(in the making😉) and software fanatic specialized in the modern JavaScript stack with sperience in the latest web technologies including React.js, Node, GraphQL and Typescript. Driven by continious improvement looking to contribute to the AMAZING software COMMUNITY. 

Motivated by curiosity I decided at a young age to pursue a carrer in the software industry. 

At the moment I am developing my skills in JS, React and Typescript also the tedious testing part working with Cypress. 

In my free time, I like to run and watch: JS.

Have yourself a LOVELY DAY :)
